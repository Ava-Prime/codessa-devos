# ADR 0009: Use Notion as the Workspace and Primary Developer Interface

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2024-11-01
- Deciders: Phoenix

## Context and Problem Statement

Codessa DevOS needs an intuitive, flexible, and collaborative frontend interface for:

- Browsing Codexes (AI scripts, workflows, agents)
- Creating and managing Scrolls (reflections, ideas, use cases)
- Hosting persistent developer state across sessions
- Viewing generated plans, summaries, and architecture maps
- Syncing with developer productivity tools (GitHub, Jira, etc.)

Rather than building a fully custom dashboard UI from scratch, we sought to leverage a best-in-class productivity and knowledge tool.

## Considered Options

1. 🧠 Notion (with API integration)
2. 🌐 Custom-built frontend using React or Streamlit only
3. 🧾 Google Docs or Sheets (manual workflows)
4. ✨ Obsidian, Airtable, or other productivity apps
5. ❌ Local markdown files + git

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: Notion

### Positive Consequences

- ✨ Elegant user experience for reading, editing, and browsing content
- 🧩 Fully scriptable via Notion API (read/write capabilities)
- 💼 Allows real-time collaboration and linking of thoughts
- 🛠️ Can be used as a lightweight CMS for Codex publishing
- 📱 Accessible across devices; ideal for async remote work

### Negative Consequences

- 🔒 Content stored on Notion’s cloud servers (requires API token access)
- ⌛️ Not ideal for high-speed querying or transactional storage
- 🧰 Requires mapping structured Firestore content → Notion schema manually
- 💳 Paid plans required for advanced sharing, automation, and integration limits

## Integration Strategy

We use Notion as the “developer glass” layer — a human-facing window into Codessa’s cognitive processes.

Core usage includes:

- Syncing Scrolls from Firestore into Notion databases
- Publishing agent thoughts, codex descriptions, and architectural diagrams
- Reviewing changelogs, timelines, and generated specs
- Creating Codex Marketplace tiles via a Notion collection view

Each codessa scroll, codex, or plan is backed by a document in Firestore and mirrored into Notion via the Notion SDK.

Example sync architecture:

```text
Firestore → codessa-reflections
         ↘
           Codessa Sync Agent → Notion (scrolls table, codex gallery)

Justification
While a custom frontend (e.g., Streamlit or React) would offer full control, Notion provides the perfect hybrid of structured + unstructured content, collaboration, and extensibility — allowing Codessa to move faster and stay developer-centric.
