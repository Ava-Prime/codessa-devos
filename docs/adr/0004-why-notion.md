# ADR 0004: Use Notion as the Developer OS Interface and Agent Control Surface

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2024-10-29
- Deciders: Phoenix
- Supersedes: None

## Context and Problem Statement

Codessa DevOS is not only a reasoning agent — it's a workspace. To support creative software development, agent planning, and transparent logging of its cognition, we need a powerful human-facing interface that can:

- Present context and output (e.g., scrolls, reflections, summaries)
- Serve as a dashboard for developer notes, tasks, and memory inspection
- Organize linked documents, threads, metadata, and agent interactions
- Be familiar, collaborative, and visually structured

Rather than building a custom dashboard from scratch, we evaluated modern productivity tools with strong APIs and semantic structure.

## Considered Options

1. 🧠 Notion (structured document workspace + public API)
2. 📋 Google Docs / Sheets (low-structure, weaker APIs)
3. 🧰 Custom Streamlit dashboards (flexible but duplicative)
4. 📚 Obsidian / Markdown vaults (local + plugins, no official API)
5. 📈 AirTable / Retool (more data-grid than document-focused)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: Notion, as the central interface for Codessa's Developer Operating System (DevOS)

### Positive Consequences

- 📚 Rich documents + structured tables: Ideal for representing scrolls, action logs, debug metadata, and more.
- 🔗 Bi-directional linking: We can mirror memory entries with backlinks to prompts, agents, tools.
- 🌐 Collaborative editing: Notion supports multi-user workspaces and comment threads — perfect for co-development.
- ⚙️ Public API support: Programmatic access to pages, databases, and properties enables seamless syncing with Codessa's Firestore state.
- 🧭 Acts as a control surface: Users can influence agent focus, strategy, or memory structure by editing linked Notion pages.

### Negative Consequences

- 📦 Not a backend store: Notion is not suitable for high-frequency data writes, long-term archive, or concurrent data locking.
- 💸 API rate limits: The Notion API has usage quotas which may require throttling or batching.
- 🔐 Access control: Requires secure handling of integration tokens and workspace permissions.

## Notes

We treat Notion as the agent's external "interface to humanity" — a bridge between Phoenix and Ava. It acts as:

- A shared whiteboard for developer ideas
- A memory mirror for long-term scrolls and thought structures
- A control dashboard for Codessa's DevOS tools

In future phases, we may introduce real-time syncing with Notion tables for "live coding memory", but for MVP-1 we will push key reflections, outputs, and summaries as daily notes.
